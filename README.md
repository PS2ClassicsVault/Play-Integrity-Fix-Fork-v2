# Play Integrity Fix Fork v2
Universal modular fix for Play Integrity (and SafetyNet) on devices running Android 8-16

This module is a fork from a developer named: chiteroman

This module is an experimental version based on his/her latest.19.1 release in order to achieve Basic and device integrity checks in googles new latest integrity api check.

# Aditional information:
This module cannot do it alone, it requires two different components to finction you will need the following modules to get full integrity.

- [TrickyStore](https://github.com/5ec1cff/TrickyStore)
- [TrickyStore - AddOn Module](https://github.com/KOWX712/Tricky-Addon-Update-Target-List)

You will need to have zygisk enabled and a already configured deny list in your root manager or via a 3rd party module with enforce deny list enabled.
