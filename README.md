# Play Integrity Fix by chiteroman
Universal modular fix for Play Integrity (and SafetyNet) on devices running Android 8-15

This module is a reupload from a developer named: chiteroman

This module has been reuploaded due to the original developers repo suddenly disappeared, this module will help to achieve Basic and device integrity checks in googles new latest integrity api check.

# Aditional information:
This module cannot do it alone, it requires two different components to finction you will need the following modules to get full integrity.

- [TrickyStore](https://github.com/5ec1cff/TrickyStore)
- [TrickyStore - AddOn Module](https://github.com/KOWX712/Tricky-Addon-Update-Target-List)

You will need to have zygisk enabled and a already configured deny list in your root manager or via a 3rd party module with enforce deny list enabled.

If you are wondering about if this module will be updated, its unsure as i am not the original developer of this module, however if your the original would like to continue your work please contact me via issues tsb so i can add you as a collaborator.
